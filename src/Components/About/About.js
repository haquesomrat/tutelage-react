                <h5>Education is both the act of teaching knowledge<br /> to others and the act of  receiving knowledge<br /> from someone else. Education also refers to the<br /> knowledge received through schooling or instruction <br />and to the institution of teaching as a whole.</h5>

                <h5>The Importance of Education Education is an important issue in one’s<br /> life. It is the key to success in the future and to have many opportunities<br /> in our life. Education has many advantages for people. For instance,<br /> it illuminates a person’s mind and thinking. It helps students to plan <br />for work or pursue a higher education while graduating from university. Having education<br /> in an area helps people think, feel, and behave in a way that contributes to their success,<br /> and improves not only their personal satisfaction but also their community.<br /> In addition, education develops human personality, thoughts, dealing with others and<br /> prepares people for life experiences. It makes people have a special status<br /> in their own society and everywhere they live in. I believe that everyone is entitled<br /> to have education ‘’from cradle to grave’’. There are various benefits of having education<br /> such as having a good career, having a good status in society, and having self-confidence.<br /> First of all, education gives us the chance of having a good career in our life.<br /> We can have plenty of chances to work at any workplace we wish. In other<br /> words, opportunities for a better employment can be more and easy.</h5>
